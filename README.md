A little platformer game that was for the midterm exam for my 3D Games Basics course.<br/>
Made by Valentin Gerard, Victor Kern and myself.

What I personnaly did on this game : 

- Inventory managment and receipe system
- UI & Pause menu
- Life & Game Over managment
- End game managment 
- Chest mechanic
